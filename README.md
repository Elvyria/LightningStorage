# Lightning Storage
My personal blazingly fast fork of [MagicStorage v0.4.3.3](https://github.com/blushiemagic/MagicStorage), an item storage mod for Terraria.  

(This mod is not trying to follow original mod development and I have absolutely no desire to look at their code in it's current state)

### Features
* Most of the codebase was rewritten into something simple and maintainable.
* Everything non strictly storage related was removed - radiant jewels, shadow diamonds.
* Blazingly fast.
* Animations
* No feature bloat.
* Easy to hack and contribute.
* Single portable access for both crafting and storage.

### Anti-Features
* No multiplayer.
* No controller support.
* No NPC's, additional workbenches or anything that goes out of scope.
* No additional filtering features.
* Not compatible with the original mod in some places.

### Other
* Removed recipe integrations with [Legend of Terraria 3](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/legend-of-terraria-3.44805/) and [Elemental Unleash](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/elemental-unleash-bluemagics-endgame-bosses-mod.45905/).
* Removed Creative Storage Unit.
* [Optimized](https://github.com/Elvyria/LightningStorage/commit/6bc708071cd2c8b712f5f8f36c19c9afd2b0a066) all assets.
* Different sorting algorithm (currently sucks). 
* Clickable ingredients that show recipe.
* Craftable ingredients are color coded.
* Removed Shadow Diamond and Radiant Jewel.
* Localization is [separated](Localization) from code.
